# physics
Repository for physics solutions and problems for Prof. Schoch's physics classes.<br>
The contents will be Maple files, Jupyter notebook pages, and python programs to help in solving <br>
physics problems.
Writing for use in github can be found:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github
<br>
Equations can be embedded in a github document by using LaTex markup.  The equation block must just be preceeded by a double dollar sign and end with a double dollar sign.
$$\sum \overset{\scriptscriptstyle \rightharpoonup}{F}=m\overset{\scriptscriptstyle \rightharpoonup}{a}=\frac{ \mathrm{d} \overset{\scriptscriptstyle \rightharpoonup}{p}}{ \mathrm{d} t}$$
